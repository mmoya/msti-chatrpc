Description
===========
Trivial chat application using ONC RPC (http://j.mp/wa6gPT). Server
uses ~/.chatrpc/chatrpc.sqlite as persistent storage.

Only for demonstrative purposes, security and error management are
weak. Not intended for real usage.

Exercise guideline at http://j.mp/zi7Hf1 (open with a browser).

Building
========
$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 libsqlite3-dev
$ make

Launching server
================
$ ./chatrpcserver

Using client
============
Default <host> is localhost.
Default <user> is the current user.

Register and saves received passwd in ~/.chatrpc/client.passwd:
$ ./chatrpcclient [--host <host>] [--user <user>] --register

Send a message to user joe:
$ ./chatrpcclient [--host <host>] [--user <user>] --send joe "Test message"

Ask server for messages directed to a user (requires authentication):
$ ./chatrpcclient [--host <host>] [--user <user>] --receive

Request server to delete messages directed to a user (requires authentication):
$ ./chatprcclient [--host <host>] [--user <user>] --delete
